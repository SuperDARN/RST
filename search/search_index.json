It has evolved over the years into a robust, multi-platform software toolkit for working with a variety of ITM data sets including data from the Polar, TIMED and ACE spacecraft, ground based magnetometers, Incoherrent Scatter Radars, and SuperDARN. The toolkit includes implementations of the Altitude Adjusted Coordinate System (AACGM), the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF), SGP4 and a set of coordinate transform functions. The toolkit is written using a combination of ANSI C and the Interactive Data Language (IDL) and has been tested on a variety of platforms.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#radar-software-toolkit-rst","text":"RST is a collection of data analysis, modelling and visualization tools originally developed for the SuperDARN project.
